         With over 22 years of experience in the plastics machinery business as an electrical engineer, 
         I have honed my skills in programming and automation. My expertise spans various programming languages
         including ladder logic and assembler, and I have had the opportunity to solve complex engineering problems <br/>
         across different applications. <br/>
         <br/>
         Throughout my career, I have developed a strong technical foundation, but I am now expanding my skipp set
         into the world of web design, where I am learning both front-end and back-end development. This new direction
         excites me, and I am eager to merge my engineering background with the creativity and innovation of web technologies <br/>
        <br />
        As I continue to grow and explore new possiblilities, I look forward to combining my engineering expertise with my newfound
        skills in web development to bring fresh perspectives to the tech industry.
